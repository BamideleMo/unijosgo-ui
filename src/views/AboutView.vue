      <p>
        UniJosGist is a casual project created for curating,
        creating, & sharing fun and interesting gists for all Jossites to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We enjoy telling inclusive, relatable, &
        fun gist that inspire other Jossites to live their best lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every Friday, subscribers get to read a gist with 6 (or more) fun and informative things that weâ€™ve discovered
        that week.
